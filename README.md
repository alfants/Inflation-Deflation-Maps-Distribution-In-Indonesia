This program is about the distribution of the contribution of inflation and deflation month-to-month of several commodities in Indonesia. I worked on this project when I was an intern at BPS Yogyakarta City. 

So, at that time I helped to create a map of the distribution of inflation/deflation contributions to see the traces of the distribution of commodities in Indonesia with data provided by BPS which at that time I used was the distribution data for November. 

So, for the excel data I do not publish it here because it is confidential.



Here is the dashboard view:
